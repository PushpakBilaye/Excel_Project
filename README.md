I took Video-Games Sales dataset from github to make dashboard and perform some queries on data, like vlookup, match, index, data validation, etc. I have used slicers and created some charts using pivot tables. In this dataset I analyzed sales of countries like Japan, North America, Europe in millions. There are other sales and global sales also.  
I can see that, most of sales has occurred in year 2009.
Also, I can see most of Sales of Japan are from “Role-Playing” genre which 27% of total sales.
